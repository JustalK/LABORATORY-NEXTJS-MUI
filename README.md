# LABORATORY-NEXTJS-MATERIAL-UI

This project is a set of different component adapted from material ui. The library gave a lot of example but there are not well presented and mix the css with the code.
I try to do something different here for getting an easy way to plug those component and since I am the one who built them, I know how to use them.

Obviously I am using `material-ui` and `next.js` as the core technology.
